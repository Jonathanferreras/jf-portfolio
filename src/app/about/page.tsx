      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in the city that never sleeps, New York City, I've
        always been driven by a sense of ambition and imagination. “If you can
        make it here, you can make it anywhere” isn't just a saying; it's a
        mindset I've carried with me throughout life. As a kid, I was obsessed
        with invention. Shows like <em>Dexter's Laboratory</em> and{" "}
        <em>Jimmy Neutron</em> sparked a fascination with building things that
        could make the world better. I didn't just want to use technology — I
        wanted to create it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That curiosity led me into software engineering, where I began my career
        at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. I helped build systems
        that powered train arrival screens, internal dashboards, and trip
        planning tools; real, tangible applications used by millions of New
        Yorkers each day. It taught me the value of dependable, user-focused
        technology and the real-world impact that thoughtful engineering can
        make.

        I later brought that experience to the high-speed world of competitive
        sports tech at the Drone Racing League. There, I developed real-time
        systems that processed drone telemetry, enabled live race tracking, and
        automated event scoring. It was high-stakes and fast-moving, requiring
        precision, creativity, and a calm mindset under pressure. Working across
        both public infrastructure and live-event technology has shaped me into
        an engineer who thrives in environments where reliability and innovation
        go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring a hands-on, inventive spirit to everything I do. I'm
        relentlessly curious, always exploring new technologies, and deeply
        committed to building tools that are reliable, intuitive, and impactful.
        Whether I'm creating systems to help commuters or enhance the experience
        of competitive sports, I approach every project with the same mindset:
        solve problems with clarity, creativity, and care.
      </p>
      <p>
        At my core, I'm still that kid with big dreams but now with a broader
        perspective, deeper skills, and a stronger desire than ever to build
        things that matter.
